# Reset Course Progress
I've been on and off Udemy for years. I'm sure previously there's been an option to reset course progress. I've got a few half-finished courses that I'd wish to start from scratch, but cannot seem to find an option for it

## Let's do it
1. Go to a video on the course page and open the lectures sidebar
2. Expand all subsections that have completed lectures on them (just click every section title so that the checkboxes are visible) If there are any sections you don't want to uncomplete then just leave it collapsed. (though I haven't really tested this so use at your own risk)
3. Open your browser's developer tools. You can do this by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + I or COMMAND + SHIFT + I or F12 or somewhere under tools > developer tools depending on your browser and OS.
4. Make sure you opened the developer tools on the Udemy page and not here on Reddit or some other tab.
5. In the developer tools, go to the console tab (the tab you can type code into)
6. Paste one of the above snippets in and press enter. Wait a minute and refresh the page then check if any were missed. Run it again if needed.
